difference between fragment and activity:

Fragment is part of an activity. That means an activity can have multiple fragments, fragments rely on activity.
Fragment has its lifecycle, fragment is embedded in the the activity, therefore,
fragment's life cycle methods are affected by activity's life cycle.
